## Welcome to the ForcePAD homepage

ForcePAD is an intuitive tool for visualising the behavior of structures subjected to loading and boundary conditions. The design of the user interface aims to be as intuitive as a standard image processing software. Users should be able to design structures, apply loads and define boundary conditions without knowledge of the underlying finite element model. ForcePAD is also designed to give an intuitive image of stresses and deformations in the material.

The release 2.5.0 of the application marks a new era in the ForcePAD history. The 2.5.0 release has a completely redesigned user interface and real-time force manipulation and a builtin structural optimisation module (beta).

ForcePAD is now also avaiable in the Windows App Store.
