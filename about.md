## About

ForcePAD is a 2D Plane stress finite element application designed using a image editing metaphor. First developed in 1999 the software has evolved from a research prototype to a mature educational software. The software has also been used extensively as an educational tool in teaching mechanics for industrial design students, architect students and engineering students.

The application is implemented in C++ using the Fast Light Toolkit library to create a platform independent user interface that can be used both on Windows as well as on MacOS X. To make the software responsive it uses a very simple Finite Element model combined with a fast solver based on the Newmat11 matrix library.

The 2.x versions are also available with full source code on Sourceforge.
